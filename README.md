# Player Performance Prediction


# Introduction

In the game of football, the evaluation of players for transfer, scouting, squad formation, and strategic planning is important. Therefore, the proposed project aims to apply Data Science technologies with data and machine learning algorithms to predict player football performance.

# Problem

- Identifying the individual player's performance is the problem because:
- There is a vast pool of grassroots-level players.
- Differing performance throughout the individualâ€™s career.
- Differing play conditions, positions, and varying club budgets, it becomes difficult to identify the individual player's performance value altogether.


# Dataset

The selected dataset of the players' attributes is in this URL.

# Questions?

- Is there a correlation between the potential and the overall rating of the football player?

- Is there a correlation between crossing and the overall rating of the football player?

- Is there a correlation between finishing and the overall rating of the football player?


# Experimental Setup
The experiment is performed on the Jupyter program and Python programming language. Jupyter Notebook is open-source software that allows collaborative data science, used to organize, and execute models, which were written in Python. We Also use Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly, NumPy libraries.

The specification of the device on which these programs are installed is Mackbook Pro Operating System on an Apple M1 Chip and 8 GB RAM to test the algorithm's effectiveness.
